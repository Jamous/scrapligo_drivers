Scrapligo platform drivers
=================
Scrapli needs drivers for diffrent network platforms. I am including some drivers I have created here.

https://github.com/scrapli/scrapligo/tree/main/examples/network_driver/platforms

https://github.com/scrapli/scrapligo/tree/main/assets/platforms 

These will need to be installed in the scrapli platform files, which can be found here:

```
%USERPROFILE%\go\pkg\mod\github.com\scrapli\scrapligo@v1.2.0\assets\platforms\
```

* fss3400crapli: For FS S3400 series switches
* ubnt_edgeswitch: For Ubiquiti edgemax series switches
