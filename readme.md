Scrapligo platform drivers
=================
Scrapli needs drivers for diffrent network platforms. I am including some drivers I have created here.

https://github.com/scrapli/scrapligo/tree/main/examples/network_driver/platforms

https://github.com/scrapli/scrapligo/tree/main/assets/platforms 

These will need to be installed in the scrapli platform files, which can be found here:

```
%USERPROFILE%\go\pkg\mod\github.com\scrapli\scrapligo@v1.2.0\assets\platforms\
~/go/pkg/mod/github.com/scrapli/scrapligo\@v1.2.0/assets/platforms/
```

Suported platforms:
------------------

* fs_s2805: FS s2805s series switches
* fs_s3400: FS S3400 series switches
* ubnt_edgeswitch: Ubiquiti edgemax series switches
